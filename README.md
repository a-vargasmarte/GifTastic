# GifTastic

### Introduction

GifTastic is a web application where users can explore the awesome world of gifs straight from the GIPHY database (https://giphy.com/).

### How it works:

* When you run the application, you will be shown numerous buttons with names of animals.

* Clicking any button will request a list of 10 gifs requested directly from the GIPHY database and dynamically populate the front end.

* Typing a request on the input field will result in a newly added and functional button on the front end that behaves the same way as described above.
